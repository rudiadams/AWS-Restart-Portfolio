# Hybrid Cloud Solution for a Café

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a *hybrid cloud architecture using AWS services* designed for a small café that is not fully migrated to the cloud.

The solution improves *reliability, security, scalability, and cost efficiency* while allowing the business to transition gradually instead of moving everything at once.

---

## 🏪 Business Scenario
The café currently uses:
•⁠  ⁠On-premise systems for daily operations
•⁠  ⁠Limited online tools for basic services

### Challenges:
•⁠  ⁠System downtime during peak hours
•⁠  ⁠Risk of data loss from local storage
•⁠  ⁠High cost of maintaining physical hardware
•⁠  ⁠Difficulty scaling as the business grows

---

## ☁️ Proposed Cloud Solution
A *hybrid cloud approach* using AWS:
•⁠  ⁠Critical systems remain on-site
•⁠  ⁠Hosting, storage, databases, and backups move to AWS

This reduces risk and ensures a smooth cloud adoption process.

---

## 🧰 AWS Services Used
•⁠  ⁠*Amazon EC2* – Hosts applications and the café website
•⁠  ⁠*Amazon S3* – Stores files, backups, and static website content
•⁠  ⁠*Amazon RDS* – Managed relational database service
•⁠  ⁠*AWS IAM* – Controls user access and permissions
•⁠  ⁠*Amazon CloudWatch* – Monitors system performance and logs

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview
Users access the café’s system hosted on *Amazon EC2*.  
Application data is stored in *Amazon RDS, while files and backups are stored in **Amazon S3*.  
*AWS CloudWatch* monitors performance and *IAM* ensures secure access.

---

## 🎯 Project Outcomes
•⁠  ⁠Improved system reliability
•⁠  ⁠Enhanced data security
•⁠  ⁠Reduced operational costs
•⁠  ⁠Easy scalability for future growth (online ordering, analytics, multi-branch expansion)

---

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
•⁠  ⁠AWS Cloud Fundamentals
•⁠  ⁠Hybrid Cloud Architecture
•⁠  ⁠Cloud Cost Awareness
•⁠  ⁠Cloud Security Basics (IAM)
•⁠  ⁠Technical Documentation
•⁠  ⁠Team Collaboration

## Introducing the Technologies

### Amazon Aurora

Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible, relational database engine that combines the performance and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. It delivers up to **five times the performance of MySQL** without requiring changes to most existing applications that use MySQL databases.

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to provision new server instances to minutes, giving you the ability to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

### Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)

Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks. Amazon RDS provides six database engines to choose from, including Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB.

---

## Task 1: Create an Aurora Instance

In this task, you create an Aurora database (DB) instance.

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose **RDS**.
2. In the left navigation menu, choose **Databases**.
3. Choose **Create database** and configure the following options:
   - For **Choose a database creation method**, choose **Standard create**.
   - For **Engine type**, choose **Aurora (MySQL Compatible)**.
   - For **Engine version**, choose the version specified as the default for major version **8.0**.
   - For **Templates**, choose **Dev/Test**.

4. In the **Settings** section, configure the following:
   - **DB cluster identifier:** `aurora`
   - **Master username:** `admin`
   - **Master password:** `admin123`
   - **Confirm password:** `admin123`

5. In the **Instance configuration** section, choose **Burstable classes (includes t classes)**, and choose **db.t3.medium** from the dropdown list.

6. In the **Availability & durability** section, choose **Don't create an Aurora Replica**.

   > 📝 **Note:** Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for DB instances. Since this is a lab environment, a multi-AZ deployment is not required.

7. In the **Connectivity** section, configure the following (leave all others as default):
   - **Virtual private cloud (VPC):** `LabVPC`
   - **Subnet group:** `dbsubnetgroup`
   - **Public access:** `No`
   - **VPC security group:** `Choose existing`
   - **Existing VPC security groups:** Remove the **default** security group, then choose **DBSecurityGroup**

   > 📝 **Note:** A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you create in a VPC and designate for your DB instances. The aurora subnet group was pre-created using AWS CloudFormation.

   > 💭 **Consider:** You can use Amazon VPC to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional data center network, with the benefits of AWS's scalable infrastructure.

8. In the **Monitoring** section, clear the check box for **Enable Enhanced monitoring**.

9. Expand **Additional configuration**. For **Initial database name**, enter `world`.

10. In the **Encryption** section, clear the check box for **Enable encryption**.

    > 📝 **Note:** You can encrypt RDS instances and snapshots at rest by enabling the encryption option. Encrypted data includes the underlying storage, automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots.

11. In the **Maintenance** section, clear the check box for **Enable auto minor version upgrade**.

12. Scroll to the bottom and choose **Create database**.

    > 📝 **Note:** Your Aurora DB instance may take up to 5 minutes to launch. You can continue to the next task while it provisions. If a **Suggested add-ons** pop-up appears, choose **Close**.

Once complete, you will see:

```
Successfully created database aurora.
```

> ✅ **Task complete:** You have successfully created an Aurora instance.

---

## Task 2: Connect to an Amazon EC2 Linux Instance

In this task, you log into your Amazon EC2 Linux instance, which was launched automatically when you started the lab using CloudFormation.

1. At the top of the AWS Management Console, search for and choose **EC2**.
2. In the left navigation menu, choose **Instances**.
3. Select the check box next to the instance labelled **Command Host**, and then choose **Connect**.

   > 📝 **Note:** If you do not see the **Command Host** instance, the lab may still be provisioning, or you may be in a different Region.

4. For **Connect to instance**, choose **Session Manager**.
5. Choose **Connect** to open a terminal window.

   > 📝 **Note:** If the **Connect** button is not available, wait a few minutes and try again.

> ✅ **Task complete:** You have successfully connected to the Amazon EC2 instance named Command Host.

---

## Task 3: Configure the Amazon EC2 Linux Instance to Connect to Aurora

In this task, you use the `yum` package manager to install the MariaDB client, then configure the EC2 instance to connect to the Aurora database.

### Step 1: Install the MariaDB Client

🖥️ **Command:** Run the following command to install the MariaDB client:

```bash
sudo yum install mariadb -y
```

📤 **Expected output** *(truncated)*:

```
Install  1 Package

Total download size: 8.8 M
Installed size: 49 M
...
Installed:
  mariadb.x86_64 1:5.5.68-1.amzn2.0.1

Complete!
```

### Step 2: Get the Aurora Endpoint

1. Switch to the AWS Management Console tab and search for **RDS**.
2. In the left navigation menu, choose **Databases**.
3. Wait for **aurora-instance-1** to display **Available**.
4. Choose **aurora**.
5. Choose the **Connectivity & security** tab.
6. In the **Endpoints** section, copy the **Endpoint name** for the **Writer** instance to your text editor.

The endpoint should look similar to:

```
aurora.cluster-cabcdefghijklm.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
```

> 📝 **Note:** Aurora provides the following endpoint types:
>
> - **Cluster endpoint** — Connects to the current primary DB instance. This is the only endpoint that can perform write operations (DDL statements). Example: `mydbcluster.cluster-123456789012.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306`
>
> - **Reader endpoint** — Connects to one of the available Aurora replicas for load-balanced read-only connections. Example: `mydbcluster.cluster-ro-123456789012.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306`

### Step 3: Connect to Aurora

✏️ **Copy edit:** Replace `<endpoint_goes_here>` with your copied endpoint, then run the command:

```bash
mysql -u admin --password='admin123' -h <endpoint_goes_here>
```

Your command should look similar to:

```bash
mysql -u admin --password='admin123' -h mydbcluster.cluster-123456789012.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
```

**MySQL Client Switch Reference:**

| Switch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-u` or `--user` | The MySQL username used to connect |
| `-p` or `--password` | The MySQL password used to connect |
| `-h` or `--host` | The host address of the database engine |

📤 **Expected output:**

```

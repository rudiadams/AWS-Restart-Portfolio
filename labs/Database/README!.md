# Linux Labs

## Overview
Labs I completed exploring core Linux system administration skills — file editing, user management, and permission control — all performed on Amazon EC2 instances via SSH.

---

## Labs I Completed

| Lab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Editing Files | Created and edited files using Vim and Nano text editors |
| Managing Users and Groups | Created user accounts, groups, and tested permission restrictions |

---

## Tools & Commands I Worked With

- **Vim** — keyboard-driven terminal text editor with Normal, Insert, and Command modes
- **Nano** — beginner-friendly terminal text editor with CTRL-based shortcuts
- **useradd / passwd** — creating and setting passwords for user accounts
- **groupadd / usermod** — creating groups and assigning users
- **su** — switching between user accounts
- **SSH** — securely connecting to EC2 instances via macOS terminal
- **/etc/passwd & /etc/group** — verifying users and group memberships
- **/var/log/secure** — reviewing system security and sudo activity logs

## Key Tasks I Performed

- Connected to Amazon EC2 instances via SSH using a `.pem` key file from the macOS terminal
- Created and edited files using both Vim and Nano, practising saving and discarding changes
- Created ten user accounts with assigned passwords and job roles
- Created six permission groups and assigned users based on their roles
- Switched between user accounts to test access restrictions and sudo permissions
- Reviewed system logs to verify and audit user activity

## What I Demonstrated

Through these labs, I demonstrated knowledge of:

- Linux text editors and terminal-based file management
- Multi-user system administration and access control
- Group-based permission structures in Linux
- SSH connectivity to cloud-based EC2 instances
- Security auditing using system logs
